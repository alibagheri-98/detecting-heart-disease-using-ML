# detecting-heart-disease-using-ML

This repository contains a heart disease detector developed using machine learning algorithms, along with the provided dataset. This project was done as part of the 'Machine Learning' course I enrolled in during Spring 2022, instructed by Dr. Peyvandi at Sharif University of Technology.

## Most Commonly Used Machine Learning Algorithms for Heart Disease Detection
There are several machine learning algorithms that are commonly used for heart disease detection. Here are some of the most frequently used ones:
- K Neighbors Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN)
- Deep Neural Network

## Unveiling the Core Principles and Applications in this Domain
Heart disease detection using machine learning (ML) algorithms has been a topic of research in recent years. Several studies have shown that ML algorithms can be effective in predicting and detecting heart disease. Here are some key findings:
- ML algorithms such as SVM, RF, LR, BPNN, decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and XGBoost have been used for heart disease detection [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8898839/)], [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/16/2/88)], [[3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2023.1150933)], [[6](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2161/1/012013/pdf)].
- ML algorithms can help diagnosticians reduce misdiagnosis and improve the performance of existing models like ACC/AHA models in CVD detection and prediction [[4](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=88650)], [[5](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/1022/1/012046)].
- The accuracy of the various ML techniques to classify whether a person has heart disease has been calculated, including K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and linear regression [[6](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2161/1/012013/pdf)].
- The input parameters for the ML algorithms include age, blood pressure, heartbeat, sex, ECG results, blood sugar, and other medical parameters [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/16/2/88)], [[4](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=88650)].
- The output of the ML algorithms is the probability of getting affected by heart disease [[4](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=88650)].

In conclusion, ML algorithms have shown promising results in heart disease detection and prediction. The use of ML algorithms can help improve the accuracy of existing models and reduce misdiagnosis. The input parameters for the ML algorithms include various medical parameters, and the output is the probability of getting affected by heart disease.
